# Email Classification Naive bayes implementation
This repo hosts implementation of Naive bayes from scrtach, implemented on emails dataset consisting of 960 emails to classify spam and non spam emails. 480 samples from each class. Further more all the preprocessing steps such as stop word removal, lemmatization and removal of non words on each email have been performed  </br></br>
Dataset is hosted on google drive, colab notebook will automatically download the dataset from the drive </br>
</br> 
DISCLAIMER : Accuracy is pretty low, there's some problem with the formula implemented in "Feature Vector Extraction" tab. Dont have the time to look in depth and figure out, left for future work 
Dataset is

# Files Rundown 
Repository contains 3 files </br>
1- Dataset in zip format </br>
2- Colab notebook </br>
3- Referance material from Andrew Ng's course </br>
# How to run 
All the python code is present in well formatted google colab notebook in the repository, barely few clicks are needed to re run the whole algorithm from training to testing. Dataset will be download automatically by running the cell
